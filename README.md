**ISKonomy** is a personal desktop application designed to track Abyssal and DED site profitability, ISK/hour, ISK/day and more.

⚙️ Built for speed and simplicity, ISKonomy is lightweight and features an Eve-O-style overlay that sits on top of your EVE client — so you can input your drops as you run. With support for **manual input, cargo parsing, and live Jita price pulls**, you can stay in full control of your ISK flow.
