**ISKonomy** is a personal desktop application designed to track Abyssal run profitability, ISK/hour, ISK/day and more.

⚙️ Built for speed and simplicity, ISKonomy is lightweight and features an Eve-O-style overlay that sits on top of your EVE client — so you can input your drops as you run. Currently, the app supports manual input, with future plans to support automatic cargo parsing and value tracking. This app was built as a personal project and is very early in its development from a developer whos knew to this thing, But we strive to deliver the app that all abyssal runners want to use!
